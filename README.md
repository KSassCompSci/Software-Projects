# Comprehensive Software Projects

A collection of course projects that emphasize building complete, working software deliverables (design → implementation → testing).

**Tech Stack:** Java • SDLC • Documentation • Version Control

## What this repository demonstrates
- Building and maintaining a **working application/codebase**
- Writing readable, structured code and troubleshooting defects
- Basic SDLC habits: planning, implementation, testing, documentation

### Project Highlights for Production Support:
* **Full Lifecycle Development:** Managed projects from requirements gathering to deployment, simulating the Application Development lifecycle.
* **Documentation:** Created clear technical documentation and user guides, ensuring knowledge transfer and maintainability.
* **Release Management:** Practiced version control and iterative updates, similar to managing production changes and bug fixes.

## Why it matters for Production Support
Production support frequently requires reading an existing codebase, reproducing issues, identifying root cause, and validating fixes.
